Q:Write a Java program that creates two threads. The first thread should print even numbers between 1 and 10, and the second thread should print odd numbers between 1 and 10.
  Ans:
// Java program to create two threads to print even and odd numbers

class EvenThread extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Even numbers between 1 and 10:");
    for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}

class OddThread extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Odd numbers between 1 and 10:");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    EvenThread evenThread = new EvenThread();
    OddThread oddThread = new OddThread();

    evenThread.start();
    oddThread.start();
  }
}

output
  Even numbers between 1 and 10:
2
4
6
8
10
Odd numbers between 1 and 10:
1
3
5
7
