Q: Create a Java program that simulates a bank account. The program should allow users to deposit and withdraw money, check their balance
Ans:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount() {
        this.balance = 0.0;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposit successful. New balance: $" + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount. Please try again.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. New balance: $" + balance);
        } else if (amount > balance) {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds. Please try again.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please try again.");
        }
    }

    public void checkBalance() {
        System.out.println("Current balance: $" + balance);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Bank Account Menu:");
            System.out.println("1. Deposit");
            System.out.println("2. Withdraw");
            System.out.println("3. Check Balance");
            System.out.println("4. Exit");
            System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");

            int choice = scanner.nextInt();

            switch (choice) {
                case 1:
                    System.out.print("Enter deposit amount: $");
                    double depositAmount = scanner.nextDouble();
                    account.deposit(depositAmount);
                    break;
                case 2:
                    System.out.print("Enter withdrawal amount: $");
                    double withdrawalAmount = scanner.nextDouble();
                    account.withdraw(withdrawalAmount);
                    break;
                case 3:
                    account.checkBalance();
                    break;
                case 4:
                    System.out.println("Goodbye!");
                    return;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
            }
        }
    }
}

Output:
